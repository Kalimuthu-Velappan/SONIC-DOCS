# 1 Feature Overview

SONiC is an open-source network operating system based on Debian Linux, integrated with various opensource applications. Each SONiC application generates logs with different log level for the events that are occurring on the system. Capturing and storing the logs from all the applications into persistent storage is essential for debugging the system events. In order to maintain the persistence of log information, every log message needs to be written into the SSD disk log file. The continuous write of log into SSD disk reduces the lifetime of the SSD disk and also affect the performance of the logger. 

In order to improve the performance of the logger and increase the life of SSD disk, the logs are divided into debug and non-debug logs. In this HLD the debug logs are moved to a RAM-based in-memory logging store, which is periodically saved into persistent storage. All the non-debug logs are stored directly into persistent storage(Like Disk). The division of debug and non-debug log improves the life of disk as well as the performance of the logger because the log generation rate of debug log is very high compare to non-debug logs. In-memory logging feature allows the application to log both debug and non-debug messages through a unified Syslog interface. This ensures applications can continue to use existing syslog APIs with Debug severity for in-memory logs.

## 1.1 Requirements

### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements

- It should provide a unified interface to all the SONiC applications with a different programming languages to log the information so that the client code change is not required. 
- It should leverage the existing Syslog as a unified interface for the application to log both debug and non-debug information.
- The separation of debug and non-debug logs should be based on the Log Level. 
- All the non-debug logs should be stored into persistent disk directly and stored logs should be rotated by log rotate periodically. 
- All the debug logs should be stored into in-memory first and then saved into the disk and rotated by log rotate periodically.
- All the in-memory logs should be saved into the disk when cold/fast/warm command is issued.
- In case of kernel crash, all the in-memory logs should be saved into the disk as part of kdump collection. 
- During the techsupport data collection, it should include both debug and non-debug logs. 
- Klish/Click CLI should be provided to dump and filter the logs from both debug and non debugs logs. 
- Existing syslog bebaviour(over-the-network to syslog server, user interface and persistance) for non-debug log should not affected. 

### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
- Klish/Click CLI is added to dump and filter the logs from both debug and non debugs logs. 

### 1.1.3 Scalability Requirements
- NA

### 1.1.4 Warm/fast/cold Boot Requirements
- When a user initiates the system reboot, all the In-Memory logs should be saved into the disk before it goes for the reboot.
 
# 2 Design
## 2.1 Overview

SONiC uses Syslog as a logging infrastructure for application to log information. In order to minimize the application code changes, the In-Memory infrastructure leverages the same existing Syslog infrastructure for application to log the debug information. The debug and non-debug information are classified through Syslog interface Log level as below. 

| **Log Level**         | **Log Value**     | **Classification**    |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| LOG_EMERG             |      0            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_ALERT             |      1            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_CRIT              |      2            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_ERR               |      3            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_WARNING           |      4            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_NOTICE            |      5            | Non-debug             |
| LOG_INFO              |      6            | Debug                 |
| LOG_DEBUG             |      7            | Debug                 |

Syslog provides a uniform interface to all the languages in the SONiC applications. The application uses these log level to differentiate the debug and non-debug information form logging. 
- It uses the standard Syslog mechanism for generating the debug messages.
- Is uses standard system call syslog(LOG_DEBUG,â€¦.) for sending the logs messages.
- It provides the standard interface to all the application including C, C++, Python, Go, Shell script and Perl languages.
- It minimizes the code changes on the application side because of a unified interface.

## 2.2 Current Model

SONiC uses the rsyslog as a centralized logger for receiving and storing the logs from various SONiC applications including logs from docker applications. The Rsyslog receives the logs, process the logs if some action to be taken, and then store the logs into log file present in the /var/log/ folder from disk log partition. Some of the SONiC application adds rules in the rsyslog to separate out the application-specific logs into a separate file, for example, all the audit related log messages are stored on the separate log file as /var/log/audit.log. 

## 2.3 In-Memory Logging

The In-memory Logging feature uses the rsyslog infrastructure rules to process and store the logs into In-Memory. It doesn't require any code change on the application side because it uses the same Syslog API for generating the debug information with log level as INFO or DEBUG. A simple rsyslog filter rule is added to Syslog config for filtering and storing the debug logs.

### Kernel driver 

A block of memory is reserved from kernel physical address space during bootup and mapped into userspace as a RAM block device. The RAM block is mounted as a userspace ramfs for saving the in-memory contents as a file. The following kernel parameter enforces the fixed physical memory reservation in the kernel during bootup. 

         memmap=memory-size@address

A simple kernel driver is loaded in the kernel during bootup which emulates this memory area as a block device in userspace - '/dev/im-device'. 

### In-Memory

All the In-Memory logs are initially stored in the RAM memory, and then stored them into persistent storage disk periodically. The ram-block device is formatted as in ext4 filesystem and mounted as a log file system as below. All the files stored inside the 'ramfs' folder will be treated as an in-memory file. The rsyslog uses these log files for storing the debug information. 

        # mkfs.etx4 /dev/ramdisk
        # mount /dev/ramdisk /var/log/ramfs/

### In-memory with Kdump

During the kernel crash, all the data stored in the in-memory should be written into the persistent disk. This is done using a fixed kernel memory map. During primary kernel bootup, a fixed physical memory is reserved for in-memory storage. When secondary kernel boots up, it uses the same fixed physical memory area and maps into application space as a ramfs. The kdump collection utility is enhanced to dump the in-memory contents from ramfs into persistent storage. 

### Rsyslog Policy

In order to separate out the debug information from Syslog, the following Rsyslog rule is added into the rsylog config. This will configure rsyslog to store all the debug logs into ramfs file system. 

        # Store all the INFO logs into ramfs file system.
        if $syslogseverity == 6 then {
            /var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-info.log
             stop
        }

        # Store all the DEBUG logs into ramfs file system.
        if $syslogseverity == 7 then {
            /var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-debug.log
             stop
        }


The log format remains the same as regular Syslog format as below.

        # SONiC syslog default template
		$template SONiCFileFormat,"%timegenerated:1:3:date-rfc3164% %timegenerated:9:10:date-rfc3339% %timegenerated:12:19:date-rfc3339%.%timegenerated:::date-subseconds% \
		%timegenerated:::date-year% %HOSTNAME% %syslogseverity-text:::uppercase% %syslogtag%%!msg1:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%!msg1:::drop-last-lf%\n"
        $ActionFileDefaultTemplate SONiCFileFormat


## 2.4 Log Rotation Policy

The following log rotation policy is applied to all the logs stored in the in-memory and also logs that are stored in the persistent disk. The first policy enforces the log rotate to rotate the logs stored in the in-memory file system, and then it enforces the rotated logs into the disk as part of the post-rotate script. The second policy instructs the log rotate to rotate the logs within persistent storage which is same as other Syslog rotation policy.

		# In-Memory log rotation
		/var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-info.log
		/var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-debug.log
		{
			rotate 2
			size 1M
			missingok
			notifempty
			copytruncate
			sharedscripts
			postrotate
				IMEM_FILE=$1
				FILE=${DISK_FILE/ramfs\/in-memory-/}
				cat ${IMEM_FILE}.1 >> ${DISK_FILE}
				rm -f ${IMEM_FILE}.1
				sync
			endscript
		}

		# Disk file log rotation
		/var/log/syslog-info.log
		/var/log/syslog-debug.log
        {
             size 1M
             rotate 200
             missingok
             notifempty
             compress
             delaycompress
        }

When rsyslog is being restarted, all the in-memory contents should be flushed to disk. The in-memory log rotation policy is added as part of an existing Syslog rotation policy.
The log rotation happens every 5 minutes and keeps 4 weeks of log or max size of all the logs should be less than 4G. If it reaches the 4G usage, it deletes all the oldest logs in the log folder. 

## 2.5 In-Memory Logging Policy

In order to simplify the application interface and improve the logging performance, the following policies are enforced on the in-memory logging.
- Only two In-Memory logging file is prefered as this improves the performance and simplifies the in-memory logging interface and its implementation.
- Log Rotation Policy
     - Cron job to rotate the in-memory logging for every 5 minutes.
     - Size of the log file is restricted to 1MB
- 32MB of physical memory starting at 1G is reserved for In-Memory during kernel bootup.
     - memmap=1G@32MB
- Disk write policy
     - Logs are written into the disk for every 5 minutes.
     - Logs are written into the disk when a user issues a reboot(cold/warm/fast) command.
     - During kernel panic, all the in-memory logs are written into the disk as port kdump data collection.
    
## 2.6 Tech-Support 

The techsupport script is enhanced to support the in-memory log collection as well. During the tech-support collection, all the in-memory logs are included as part of regular Syslog collection.

- All the logs from in-memory.
- All the logs which are already stored in the persistent disk.


## 2.7 In-Memory log Dump sequence

The in-memory logs should be accessed in the following order to get the log timing sequence.

For debug syslog log: 
1. /var/log/syslog-debug.log.1
2. /var/log/syslog-debug.log
3. /var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-debug.log

Similar sequence for following for info logs.

## 2.8 KLISH/CLICK Commands

The following CLI commands are supported to dump the logs from in-memory.

### Show commands

- Show all the logs from In-Memory contents. It merges both info and debug logs in the order of time sequence.

         # show log in-memory-logging [-f] [-l count] [<search keyword>]

	where:

		-f   => Follow the in-memory log 
		-l   => Show last n lines from in-memory log
		<search keyword>  => Filter the log based on the keyword
 
- Show logs from standard Syslog.

         # show logging [-f] [-l count] [<search keyword>]

	where:

		-f   => Follow the syslog 
		-l   => Show last n lines from syslog
		<search keyword>  => Filter the log based on the keyword


### Clear command

	The sonic-clear logging will clear both debug(in-memory) and non-debug logs.

		# sonic-clear logging


## 2.9 Cold/Warm/Fast Reboot

During the system reboot, all the In-Memory logs should be stored on the persistent disk. When a user initiates a system reboot command, the following sequence gets executed.

1. Append the contents of In-Memory into persistent storage file. 
2. Reset the In-Memory file pointer.
3. Let the reboot script to continue. 
4. Just before the reboot, repeat step 1 and 2 again. 

## 3.0 Kernel Crash 

During the kernel crash, all the In-memory logs should be saved into /var/log folder as part of kdump data collection. When kernel crash happens the following action sequence gets executed.

1. During the kernel bootup, it reserves the same physical memory used in the primary kernel.
2. Insert the ramdisk driver for emulating the reserved physical memory as a ram block device in the userspace.
3. During the In-Memory service startup, mount the ram block device as ramfs into /var/log/ramfs folder.
4. As part of the kdump data collection, copy the contents of in-memory contents into /var/log/ folder.
5. reboot the system. 


## 4.0 Developer Guidelines

1. In-memory storage is restricted to 32MB for all the SONiC applications.
2. Currently, the in-memory logs are divided into only two main categories of log files
	- INFO  - /var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-info.log
	- DEBUG - /var/log/ramfs/in-memory-syslog-debug.log
3. When the in-memory logging feature is enabled, all the application debug logs(INFO and DEBUG) are forward to in-memory storage.
4. Developers are recommended to use one of the in-memory log files for logging the application debug information 
   and try to avoid creating an application-specific debug file in the in-memory storage.
